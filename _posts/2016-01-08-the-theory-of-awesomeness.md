# The Theory of Awesomeness

I would like to kick-start **Dreamcatcher** by sharing the **Theory of Awesomeness**, a concept developed by the guys at [Mindvalley][0], which boils down to two rules:

* Set big, unrealistic goals, as they will pull you forward.
* Be happy here and now, wherever you in your path you may be.

I'm launching **Dreamcatcher** at a moment in my life when I realize that:

* All my dreams are being fulfilled in due time... even the most unexpected ones.
* I have learnt to be happy with black or white, with high or low, with heat or snow, with yes or no.

I would hereby like to make the solemn pact that, through this blog, I will share with you a significant amount of amazing sensory experiences that have led me---and keep on leading me---to appreciate every knot under the magical carpet that has taken me where I am, and which keeps on making me smile.

This is an invitation to fly high together on this carpet, through the depth of dark oceans and colorful changing seasons, through hot Summer days and cold Winter nights, on the quest to discover that **catching dreams is possible, because ****it just depends on you**.

Enjoy the ride! _ah!_
